//! Observability trait for Raft node events
//!
//! Provides a platform-agnostic way to observe Raft internals for:
//! - Debugging (defmt, println)
//! - Monitoring (metrics, structured logging)
//! - Testing (capturing events for assertions)
//!
//! The implementation handles filtering and formatting internally,
//! similar to Log4Net/Log4j architecture.

/// Observer trait for Raft node events

/// Implementations should:
/// 1. Check min_level() to determine what events to log
/// 2. Format output according to platform (embedded, cloud, test)
/// 3. Handle filtering internally to keep RaftNode code clean
///
/// # Associated Types
///
/// - `Payload`: The type of data stored in log entries (must match RaftMsg)
/// - `LogEntries`: The collection type for log entries (must match RaftMsg)
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// struct MyObserver { min_level: EventLevel }
///
/// impl Observer for MyObserver {
///     type Payload = String;
///     type LogEntries = Vec<LogEntry<String>>;
///
///     fn min_level(&self) -> EventLevel { self.min_level }

///     fn leader_elected(&mut self, node: NodeId, term: Term) {
