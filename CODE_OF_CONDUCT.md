# MetalRaft Code of Conduct

## Purpose

We're here to build excellent software together. Write code, solve problems, and learn from each other.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Technical Merit First

- Contributions are judged on code quality, not who wrote them
- We critique implementations, not people
- If your PR is rejected, it's about the code, not you

### 2. Direct Communication

- Say what you mean clearly and helpfully
- "This has performance issues because X" beats "I'm not sure about this"
- Explain your reasoning when you disagree
- Clear communication saves everyone time

### 3. Professional Behavior

- Focus on the work and help each other succeed
- Follow through on commitments, or let us know if you can't
- Respond to feedback constructively
- We all make mistakes—admit them, learn, and move on

### 4. Respect for Effort

- People volunteer their time here
- Give thoughtful feedback: "This doesn't work" isn't helpful, but "This panics when X because Y" is
- If you don't have time to review properly, that's okay—just say so

---

## What We Expect

**Issues:** Be specific, show examples, search existing issues first, stay on topic

**Pull Requests:** Test your changes, match the existing style, explain what and why, be open to feedback

**Code Reviews:** Be constructive and specific, distinguish between "this is broken" and "I'd approach this differently"

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

These will result in removal from the project:

- Harassment, personal attacks, or spam
- Deliberately wasting people's time or arguing in bad faith
- Publishing private information or using multiple accounts to manipulate discussions

---

## Enforcement

1. **First issue** → Warning with explanation
2. **Second issue** → Temporary ban
3. **Third issue or severe offense** → Permanent ban

Maintainers make the final call. You can appeal once via email if you believe there was a misunderstanding.

---

## What This Code Is

- ✅ A framework for productive collaboration
- ✅ Protection against actual harassment and bad behavior
- ✅ A standard for respectful, professional technical discussion
- ✅ A commitment to judging work on its merits

---

## What This Code Isn't

- ❌ A guarantee you'll never hear critical feedback—that's how we improve
- ❌ A democracy—maintainers make final technical decisions
- ❌ A general discussion forum—let's keep issues focused on bugs and features

---

## Our Philosophy

We assume you're here because you:

- Want to build good software
- Can handle direct, honest feedback about your work
- Understand that code criticism isn't personal criticism
- Will engage in good faith and help others do the same

If this sounds reasonable, welcome! We're glad you're here.

---

## In Short

**Write good code. Communicate clearly. Be helpful. Treat people with respect.**
